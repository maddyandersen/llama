DEVLOG (Team llama)

Instructions:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
The devlog should be a plain text file, stored in the specified location.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github, they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format: firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )
