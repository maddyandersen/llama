DEVLOG (Team llama)

Instructions:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
The devlog should be a plain text file, stored in the specified location.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github, they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format: firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )

- tested Ari's login and signup functions
- found that we were able to login with an incorrect password, as long as the username existed --> no error messages 
- updated Ari's login and signup functions in __init__.py to fix this problem and include error messages
- combined __init__.py and db_manager.py into one file
- we were having an issue with the autoincrement for the user_ids, so we changed them to be random ints from 0 to 10 million (* come back to later)
- added try and excepts to several functions to prevent failure and to accommodate the fail safe error.html
- renamed loginerror.html to error.html (this is a fail safe if anything goes wrong)
- added error messages to login.html and signup.html
- deleted db_manager.py
